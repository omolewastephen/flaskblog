Many have died due to lost interest or their owners giving up on the idea, while others have thrived and continue to grow,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://makeawebsitehub.com/how-to-make-money-blogging/\" target=\"_blank\">making money</a>&nbsp;and earning their owners a steady income. It&rsquo;s a constant evolution of content that keeps people coming back for more, especially if these blogs contact highly resourceful material that people find useful and interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"img img-responsive\" alt=\"Image 1.0\" src=\"https://makeawebsitehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/missthrifty-1024x544.jpg\" style=\"height:544px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the more popular frugal blogs in the UK, Miss Thrifty is targeting young mums with her money saving, frugal tips and articles. And rightly so! The market is massive and she&rsquo;s meeting a need for this type of information. Young mums aren&rsquo;t exactly rolling in cash. They may have had to give up work and are now relying on just one wage coming in, so the need to be more frugal with everyday living is a must.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The great thing about this blog is the conversational tone and the real person behind the brand. I think it&rsquo;s inspiring to other mums to see someone like them making such a difference in other people&rsquo;s lives by creating amazingly useful content that is 100% actionable. Also it may inspire mums to set up their own blog and to write about their experiences as a mother and a wife in the 21st century.</p>\r\n', 'static/uploads/thumbnails/examples-of-blog.jpg', 'bloke', '2020-01-29 13:24:39'),
(3, 'Examples of Blogs â€“ Inspiration for New Bloggers', '<p>So when I talk about coming at a niche from a different angle, this example is exactly what I mean. Skint Dad is a site that helps young / new dads save money and be more frugal in their day to day living. There&rsquo;s also a section on their that shows guys how to make a little more cash on top of their monthly day job wage, which is vital in some cases just to keep your head above water. &nbsp;A lot of new dads have the added stress of not having their wives&rsquo; or girlfriends&rsquo; wage coming in each month, due to&nbsp;the temporary career change in being a full time mum of a baby. So having some content around how they can make a few extra &ldquo;Ps&rdquo; in their wallet each month, can ease the burden somewhat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'static/uploads/thumbnails/skintdad-1024x521.jpg', 'bloke', '2020-01-29 13:30:06');
